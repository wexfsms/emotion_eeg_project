This project classifies emotional states (Positive / Negative) from EEG signal data using statistical, entropy-based, and Hjorth features. Dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA, and classification was done using LightGBM.
Built as part of an academic research internship at NIT Durgapur.

🧠 Objective
To design a machine learning pipeline that can accurately classify emotional states from EEG signals using efficient feature extraction and gradient boosting.

🚀 Key Features
🧪 EEG Signal Processing from multichannel data

⚙️ Feature Extraction:

Statistical (mean, std, skewness, etc.)

Entropy (Shannon, Spectral)

Hjorth parameters (Mobility, Complexity)

🧩 Dimensionality Reduction: PCA

📈 Model: LightGBM (binary classification)

📊 Accuracy Achieved: ~89% - 96%
